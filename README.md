##London Underground Route Finder
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two stations on the London Underground network. It comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5 for ease of use.

#Features
Find the optimal route between any two stations.
Estimate the time of arrival (ETA) based on the current time and travel time.

#Setup and Usage
1.Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the following libraries:
-openpyxl
-PyQt5
2.Run the Application: Navigate to the project directory and run the main.py file:
3.Input Start and Destination Stations: Enter the names of the start and destination stations in the provided text fields.
4.Find Route: Click on the "Find Route" button to calculate the optimal route and ETA.

#Notes
Ensure the provided station names match the names in the London Underground dataset for accurate results.
This project assumes a correctly formatted dataset for the London Underground network. Ensure your data adheres to the required format for proper functionality.
The project currently does not include visualization of the route on the London Underground map.
This project is unfinished and does not properly display when to transfer Tubes.
